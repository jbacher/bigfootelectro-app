final String volunteerQuestion = "HOW CAN I VOLUNTEER?";
final String volunteerAnswer = ''' Bigfoot Electro offers all patrons the opportunity to get involved in the event. We are looking to open the land to people who wish to give back to the community. If this sounds like you – read on…

Would you like to volunteer by organizing a theme camp, a class or some other kind of undertaking? Examples of acceptable ideas for an activity may include morning yoga, a fireside chat about a particular topic, a sober camp, a song writing seminar,  guitar lessons, and more. If you would like to host a seminar, a workshop, a talk, or some other ‘flavor’ of a group activity… Get in touch!

Alternatively, we will be needing approximately 50 people to join various volunteers crews (i.e., parking, arrival gate, trash pickup). If you’d like to help, contact us now while there are still spots left!
